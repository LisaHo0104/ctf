# 🏴‍☠️ Web Exploitation CTF Write-ups

Welcome 👋  
This blog documents my learning journey in **Web Exploitation** through legal **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges.

All write-ups are organised by **difficulty level** and **learning phase**, focusing on understanding **why vulnerabilities exist**, not just how to exploit them.

## EASY — Web Exploitation Fundamentals

*Goal: Build strong foundations by learning how websites, browsers, and basic web security mistakes work.*

### Phase 1 – Inspection & Hidden Data
*Information hidden in plain sight*

- [Inspect HTML](writeups/inspect-html.md)
- [Insp3ct0r](writeups/insp3ct0r.md)
- [Scavenger Hunt](writeups/scavenger-hunt.md)
- [Unminify](writeups/unminify.md)
- [Where Are the Robots](writeups/where-are-the-robots.md)

---

### Phase 2 – Encoding & Decoding
*Obfuscation and data representation*

- [WebDecode](writeups/webdecode.md)

---

### Phase 3 – Cookies & Sessions
*Client-side state and authentication*

- [Cookies](writeups/cookies.md)
- [Cookie Monster Secret Recipe](writeups/cookie-monster-secret-recipe.md)
- [Local Authority](writeups/local-authority.md)

---

### Phase 4 – HTTP Requests & Headers
*Understanding HTTP methods and headers*

- [GET aHEAD](writeups/get-ahead.md)
- [head-dump](writeups/head-dump.md)
- [IntroToBurp](writeups/intro-to-burp.md)

---

### Phase 5 – Client-Side vs Server-Side Logic
*Trust boundaries and validation*

- [dont-use-client-side](writeups/dont-use-client-side.md)
- [Crack the Gate 1](writeups/crack-the-gate-1.md)
- [logon](writeups/logon.md)

---

### Phase 6 – File Inclusion & Path Traversal
*Unsafe file access*

- [Includes](writeups/includes.md)

---

### Phase 7 – Injection Vulnerabilities
*Executing unintended code*

- [SSTI1](writeups/ssti1.md)

---

### Phase 8 – JavaScript Abuse
*Abusing browser-side execution*

- [Bookmarklet](writeups/bookmarklet.md)

---

## MEDIUM — Intermediate Web Exploitation


## 🔴 HARD — Advanced Web Exploitation
